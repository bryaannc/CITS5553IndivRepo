The COCO dataset, for example, has classes associated with class IDs 70 and 72, but not 71.\n","\n","To improve consistency, and to support training on data from multiple sources at the same time, our ```Dataset``` class assigns it's own sequential integer IDs to each class. For example, if you load the COCO dataset using our ```Dataset``` class, the 'person' class would get class ID = 1 (just like COCO) and the 'teddy bear' class is 78 (different from COCO). Keep that in mind when mapping class IDs to class names.\n","\n","To get the list of class names, you'd load the dataset and then use the ```class_names``` property like this.\n","```\n","# Load COCO dataset\n","dataset = coco.CocoDataset()\n","dataset.load_coco(COCO_DIR, \"train\")\n","dataset.prepare()\n","\n","# Print class names\n","print(dataset.class_names)\n","```\n","\n","We don't want to require you to download the COCO dataset just to run this demo, so we're including the list of class names below.
